# Anchore go-make

go-make is a golang-based scripting utility and task runner with minimal dependencies, designed to help with common development tasks in a cross-platform manner.

## Project Overview

- **Purpose**: Provides a simple DSL for defining build tasks and development workflows that work consistently across platforms
- **Language**: Go (requires Go 1.23.1+)
- **Module**: `github.com/anchore/go-make`

## Key Features

- Cross-platform development utilities
- Task runner with minimal dependencies
- Sharable task definitions through Go modules
- Built-in support for common tasks like linting and testing
- Template variable support and managed executable downloads

## Architecture

- Tasks are defined in `.make/main.go` using the go-make DSL
- Common task definitions are available as importable packages (e.g., `golint`, `gotest`, `release`)
- Uses a Makefile wrapper that delegates to `go run -C .make . $@`
- Supports task dependencies and conditional execution

## Dependencies

- **Required**: `go`, `git`
- **Optional**: `docker` (or compatible CLI like `podman`) for container-based tasks
- Additional tools managed through binny config or go.mod tools section

## Usage Pattern

Tasks are defined by creating a `.make/main.go` file that imports go-make and defines a Makefile with various Task definitions. Each task can specify dependencies, run conditions, and execution logic.
